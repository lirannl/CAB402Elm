# CAB402 Elm vs JS demonstration
This repository contains two webapps I wrote, one in Elm, and another in JavaScript.
It is made for a QUT Assignment on programming paradigms.
Both apps access a fake data JSON API, located at https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/.

Both applications intentionally exlucde edge-case handling as much as possible (with no compile-time errors/warnings).
These applications are built to demonstrate how Elm creates such reliable webapps.
